COVID-19 
   During the COVID-19 pandemic, there might be a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and decreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services even for a short time can result in increased numbers of susceptible individuals and raise the likelihood of outbreak-prone vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles.

WHO Advice
Measles anywhere is a problem everywhere because it spreads so easily. WHO recommends that countries in all regions continue to make progress towards achieving measles elimination in line with each of the endorsed Regional Goals of all WHO regions to achieve measles elimination, as well as the global strategy under IA2030, the Measles and Rubella Strategic Framework.

WHO recommends strengthening the efforts to implement the "Plan of Action for the Sustainability of Measles, Rubella, and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Elimination in the Americas 2018-2023", with its four strategic sections: 1) guarantee universal access to vaccination services; 2) strengthen the capacity of epidemiological surveillance systems for measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome; 3) develop the national operational capacity to maintain the elimination status; 4) establish standard mechanisms for rapid response to imported measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome cases to prevent the re-establishment of endemic transmission in the countries.

WHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to highly suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing national rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with permanent communication channels between all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management to avoid nosocomial transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.  </div>
  <div id="sectionB" class="tab-pane fade">
 On 12 August 2023, the IHR National Focal Point of Chile notified WHO of a confirmed case of measles in the Metropolitan Region. The case had history of travel to Georgia, where measles is endemic, and Armenia, where measles has been eliminated, and returning to Chile via Qatar and Brazil. To date no further cases related to this importation have been detected.

This is the first measles case reported in Chile since 2020. As soon as the case was notified, the local and national authorities implemented control measures, including case isolation and an epidemiological investigation to identify the exposed contacts and refer them for vaccination, and reinforced surveillance activities in the public and private health network.

Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease but can be prevented by immunization. Chile interrupted local transmission of measles in 1993. Imported cases are expected, and the susceptibility of contacts determines the spread of the disease.

Description of the situation
 </div>
  <div id="dropdown1" class="tab-pane fade">
Public Health Response
The following public health measures were implemented by local and national health authorities:

Intensification of epidemiological surveillance with active and retrospective institutional search for cases.
Identification and follow-up of contacts for 21 days post-exposure.
Vaccination of contacts if there was no immunization record.
Use of standard immunoglobulin in the population at risk.
Notification, through IHR NFPs, of contacts who travelled to other countries.
Sending information to the IHR NFP of Georgia and Armenia for follow-up.
Additionally, during the second semester of this year, the updated strategy for students from 1st to 8th grade will be implemented in Chile [1].

WHO Risk Assessment
Measles remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide. It is highly contagious, with 90% of non-immune people exposed to an infectious individual estimated to contract the disease.  

In 2016, the Region of the Americas was the first Region of WHO to be declared free of endemic transmission of measles viruses by the International Expert Committee (IEC) for Documenting and Verifying Measles, Rubella and the Congenital Rubella Syndrome in the Americas. Nevertheless, maintaining the Region free of measles is an ongoing challenge due to the permanent risk of importation and reintroduction of the virus. This case corresponds to a susceptible cohort of people born between 1971 and 1981 who were not immunized with two doses of MMR or did not previously present with the disease.



WHO recommends vaccination of at-risk populations without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella, such as health care workers, persons working in tourism and transportation (hotels, airports, border crossings, mass transportation, and others), and international travellers who are visiting measles endemic countries. Implementing a plan to immunize migrant populations in high-traffic border areas, prioritizing those considered at-risk, including both migrants and residents, in these municipalities increases vaccination coverage to increase population immunity.

In all settings consideration should be given to providing susceptible contacts with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), including a dose of MCV or normal human immunoglobulin (NHIG) (if available) for those at risk and in whom the vaccine is contraindicated. In well-resourced settings, MCV should be provided to susceptible contacts within 3 days. For contacts for whom vaccination is contraindicated or is not possible within 3 days post-exposure, consideration can be given to providing NHIG up to 6 days post-exposure. Infants, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised should be prioritized.

WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the MCV vaccine in all municipalities and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public, private, and social security healthcare facilities.

WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the measles-rubella (MR)and/or measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, and syringes/supplies for control actions of imported cases. Facilitating the access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to foreigners or people from the same country who perform temporary activities in countries with ongoing outbreaks; displaced populations; indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.

WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Chile based on the information available on the current outbreak.

What is Acute Flaccid Myelitis?
Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare but serious condition that affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, causing the muscles and reflexes in the body to work abnormally. This type of condition is not new. Anyone can get AFM or neurologic conditions like it. There are different possible causes, such as viruses, toxins, and genetic disorders.

What are the signs and symptoms?
Most patients will have sudden onset of limb weakness and loss of muscle tone and reflexes. Some patients also will experience:

facial droop/weakness
difficulty moving the eyes
drooping eyelids
difficulty with swallowing or slurred speech
Numbness or tingling is rare in patients with AFM, though some patients have pain in their arms or legs. Some patients with AFM may be unable to pass urine. The most severe symptom of AFM is respiratory failure that can happen when the muscles involved with breathing become weak. This can require urgent ventilator support (breathing machines).

If you or your child develops any of these symptoms, you should seek medical care right away.

What causes AFM?
Acute flaccid myelitis can be caused by a variety of pathogens, including several viruses:

enteroviruses (polio and non-polio)
West Nile virus (WNV) and viruses in the same family as WNV, specifically Japanese encephalitis virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus
adenoviruses
AFM is one of a number of conditions that can result in neurologic illness with limb weakness. Such illnesses can result from a variety of causes, including viral infections, environmental toxins, genetic disorders, and Guillain-Barre syndrome, a neurologic disorder caused by an abnormal immune response that attacks the body’s nerves. Oftentimes, however, despite extensive laboratory testing, a cause for AFM is unable to be identified.

How is AFM treated?
There is no specific treatment for AFM, but a neurologist may recommend certain interventions on a case-by-case basis.

Surveillance
The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) is re-emphasizing the importance of continued vigilance in identifying cases of AFM among all age groups, irrespective of enterovirus status. Reporting of these cases will help public health officials monitor for increases in this illness and better understand potential causes, risk factors, and preventive measures or therapies. We are asking all clinicians to report AFM cases to the local health department, governing the jurisdiction where the patient lives.

Reporting
ACUTE FLACCID MYELITIS CASE DEFINITION 
Clinicians suspecting AFM in patients meeting the probable or confirmed case definition (irrespective of laboratory testing results) are asked to report these cases to the local health department governing the jurisdiction where the patient lives, or to the Illinois Department of Public Health Communicable Disease Control Section at 217-782-2016. Clinicians should complete the patient summary form and submit it along with the MRI report and images to their LHD as early as possible. Clinicians or infection control practitioners that have access to enter reportable diseases into the Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (I-NEDSS) should also enter the case’s information into the system’s AFM module. Local health departments (LHD) should report AFM cases into I-NEDSS as an AFM case if the clinician has not done so.

In addition to the patient summary form, MRI report, and images, the provider will be asked to submit the following information approximately 60 days after onset of the illness so CDC is able to better evaluate the impact of AFM:

History and Physical
Additional MRI reports and images
Neurology consult notes
EMG report (if done)
Infectious disease consult notes
Vaccination record
Diagnostic lab reports
The local health department will help facilitate the collection of this information.

Specimen Collection and Testing
Clinicians should collect specimens from patients suspected of having AFM as early as possible in the course of illness, preferably on the day of onset of limb weakness. Early specimen collection has the best chance to yield a diagnosis of AFM. CDC has specimen collection procedures on their website. Please refer to CDC’s collection procedures for the most up-to-date instructions. NOTE: Surveillance specimen coordination should be done in conjunction with the LHD and/or IDPH CD section prior to shipment. Please contact your local health department or IDPH to arrange specimen submission.

The following three forms must be completed and included with all specimen submissions to IDPH laboratory:

IDPH Communicable Diseases Laboratory Test Requisition Form
CDC 50.34 DASH Form: (Please contact the IDPH laboratory if assistance is needed with this form.)
CDC AFM Patient Summary Form
Medical providers and infection control practitioners should contact their local health department with questions about AFM reporting. Local health departments with questions should contact IDPH Communicable Disease Control Section at 217-782-2016.

What are alphaviruses?
Alphaviruses are viruses that attack the brain. There are three main types: 1) eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE); 2) Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE); and 3) western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE).

How can someone come into contact with an alphavirus?
Outbreaks of alphaviruses usually occur in the summer. A person can come into contact with an alphavirus by being bit by a mosquito.

Alphaviruses as weapons
Because they are stable during storage and can be made in large amounts, alphaviruses are considered to be easily weaponized. The viruses can be aerosolized and dispersed into the air.

Please note: Just because you come into contact with an alphavirus does not mean you will get sick from it.

What happens if someone gets sick from an alphavirus?
Most infections with these viruses produce a fever, headache and muscle pain. Severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, seizures, coma and possibly even death can occur.

How likely is someone to die from an alphavirus?
EEE, the most serious of the infections, has a high death rate (up to 35 percent). It also has a high rate of causing problems with the brain. VEE and WEE are less likely to cause brain-related symptoms. VEE has a death rate of less than 1 percent; WEE has a death rate of less than 3 percent.

What is the treatment for alphaviruses?
Prevention of illness after contact
None

Treatment of illness
There is no specific treatment or established cure for alphaviruses. Supportive care (intravenous fluids, medicine to control fever and pain) is the standard treatment.

Are there vaccines for alphaviruses?
There are vaccines available but there have been problems with their success. New vaccines are in development.

What should be done if someone comes into contact with an alphavirus?
If you think that you or someone you know may have come into contact with an alphavirus, contact the local county health department right away. 

If you or someone you know is showing symptoms of an alphavirus, call your health care provider or the Illinois Poison Center right away. The toll-free number for the poison center is 1-800-222-1222.

Asthma
RESOURCES PUBLICATIONS 
What is asthma?
Asthma is a condition that affects the airways. It makes it hard to breathe because the airways become swollen, produce too much mucus and the muscles around the airways tighten. Asthma can range from mild to severe and can be life threatening. It is recognized that in some families, inherited factors play a role in an individual’s risk for asthma. If a parent, or other close relative, has been diagnosed with asthma, a child may be at an increased risk for the condition; family history is important in the assessment and treatment of asthma. There is no cure for asthma, but it can be controlled by ongoing medical care, including a management plan developed by a health care provider, medication, avoidance of triggers and good health habits.

Origins of asthma – what causes asthma?
The exact cause of asthma is not known; there is not a single cause of asthma. The causes of asthma symptoms can vary for different people. Most often starts in childhood, and some researchers think genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma.

Allergies – Exposure to allergens plays a causative role in the development of asthma.
Asthma runs in families – Children who have a parent or sibling with asthma are 3- to 6-times more likely to develop asthma than children without a family history of asthma.
Respiratory infections in childhood – Viral infections in infancy is a risk factor for development of asthma.
How is asthma diagnosed?
It is often difficult for a doctor to make an asthma diagnosis, because symptoms are similar to other respiratory conditions, such as bronchitis and upper respiratory infection. A diagnosis of asthma is based on the following:

Symptoms
Family history
Lung function test, such as a spirometry test
What are the warning signs of an asthma attack?
Warning signs are symptoms that someone is having difficulty with asthma. Symptoms of an asthma attack may include:

Shortness of breath
Cough
Feeling tired or weak
Itchy chin or throat
Watery eyes
Dark circles under eyes
Stomachache
Medications are not working or do not last
Increase in coughing or tightness in chest
Wheezing
Inability to do usual activities
All of these symptoms do not necessarily occur during an asthma attack. Asthma attacks may occur anytime, but there are risk factors that can trigger an attack.

What can make asthma worse?
There are a number of different risk factors, also known as triggers that can make a person’s asthma worse. Not every person will be affected by the same things. Discover which triggers make your asthma worse and learn ways to reduce exposure and to prevent symptoms. Some examples of triggers are:

Tobacco smoke
Dust mites
Mold
Viral infections
Pollen
Pollution
Strong odors
Animal dander
Cockroaches
Exercise
Cold weather
How can I control my asthma?
Work with your health care provider to develop an action plan that includes what to do if you have an asthma attack. The plan should address the following:

what happens during an asthma attack,
what triggers an asthma attack and how to avoid these triggers,
early recognition of warning signs and symptoms,
list of medications,
the importance of early treatment in response to asthma symptoms,
how to keep an asthma diary, and
how to use a peak flow meter (a peak flow meter is a hand-held device that measures how well air moves out of the lungs. It can be helpful in warning of an asthma attack and can help to identify triggers, to monitor a treatment plan and to assess the severity of asthma).
Recognize your symptoms early and know the difference between your controller medicine and your reliever medicine. Take your controller medication regularly, even when you are not having asthma symptoms.

Learn as much as possible about asthma and communicate with your health care provider and others involved in the management of your asthma. If your child has asthma, it is important for you to communicate with school staff, coaches, child care providers and others about his/her "Asthma Action Plan"

Bacterial Vaginosis
RESOURCES 
What is bacterial vaginosis?
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition in women where the normal balance of bacteria in the vagina is disrupted and replaced by an overgrowth of certain bacteria. It is sometimes accompanied by discharge, odor, pain, itching or burning.

How common is bacterial vaginosis?
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. In the United States, BV is common in pregnant women.

How do people get bacterial vaginosis?
The cause of BV is not fully understood. BV is associated with an imbalance in the bacteria that are normally found in a woman's vagina. The vagina normally contains mostly "good" bacteria, and fewer "harmful" bacteria. BV develops when there is an increase in harmful bacteria.

Not much is known about how women get BV. There are many unanswered questions about the role that harmful bacteria play in causing BV. Any woman can get BV. However, some activities or behaviors can upset the normal balance of bacteria in the vagina and put women at increased risk including:

Having a new sex partner or multiple sex partners
Douching
Using an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception
It is not clear what role sexual activity plays in the development of BV. Women do not get BV from toilet seats, bedding, swimming pools, or from touching objects around them. Women who have never had sexual intercourse may be affected.

What are the signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis?
Women with BV often have an abnormal vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor. Some women report a strong fish-like odor, especially after intercourse. The discharge is usually white or gray; it can be thin. Women with BV may have burning during urination or itching around the outside of the vagina, or both. Some women with BV report no signs or symptoms at all.

How is bacterial vaginosis diagnosed?
A health care provider must examine the vagina for signs of BV (e.g., discharge) and perform laboratory tests on a sample of vaginal fluid to look for bacteria associated with BV.

What are the complications of bacterial vaginosis?
In most cases, BV causes no complications. But there are some serious risks from BV including:

Having BV can increase a woman's susceptibility to HIV infection if she is exposed to the HIV virus.
Having BV increases the chances that an HIV-infected woman can pass HIV to her sex partner.
Having BV has been associated with an increase in the development of an infection following surgical procedures such as a hysterectomy or an abortion.
Having BV while pregnant may put a woman at increased risk for some complications of pregnancy, such as preterm delivery.
BV can increase a woman's susceptibility to other STDs, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), chlamydia and gonorrhea.
How does bacterial vaginosis affect a pregnant woman and her baby?
Pregnant women with BV more often have babies who are born premature or with low birth weight (low birth weight is less than 5.5 pounds).

The bacteria that cause BV can sometimes infect the uterus (womb) and fallopian tubes (tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus). This type of infection is called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause infertility or damage the fallopian tubes enough to increase the future risk of ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening condition in which a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube which can rupture.

Who should be treated for bacterial vaginosis?
Although BV will sometimes clear up without treatment, all women diagnosed with BV should be treated to avoid such complications as PID. Treatment is especially important for pregnant women. All pregnant women, regardless of symptoms, who have ever had a premature delivery or low birth weight baby should be considered for a BV examination and be treated when necessary. All pregnant women who have symptoms of BV should be checked and treated. Male partners generally do not need to be treated. However, BV may spread between female sex partners. 

Treatment is especially important for pregnant women. All pregnant women who have ever had a premature delivery or low birth weight baby should be considered for a BV examination, regardless of symptoms, and should be treated if they have BV. All pregnant women who have symptoms of BV should be checked and treated.

Some physicians recommend that all women undergoing a hysterectomy or abortion be treated for BV prior to the procedure, regardless of symptoms, to reduce their risk of developing an infection.

BV is treatable with antibiotics prescribed by a health care provider. Two different antibiotics are recommended as treatment for BV: metronidazole or clindamycin. Either can be used with non-pregnant or pregnant women, but the recommended dosages differ. Women with BV who are HIV-positive should receive the same treatment as those who are HIV-negative.

How can bacterial vaginosis be prevented?
BV is not completely understood by scientists, and the best ways to prevent it are unknown. However, it is known that BV is associated with having a new sex partner or having multiple sex partners.

The following basic prevention steps can help reduce the risk of upsetting the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina and developing BV:
Be abstinent.
Limit the number of sex partners.
Do not douche.
Use all of the medicine prescribed for treatment of BV, even if the signs and symptoms go away.

RESOURCES PUBLICATIONS 
The Division of Epidemiologic Studies conducted an assessment to determine if there is elevated cancer incidence in the population surrounding the Sterigenics facility in Willowbrook, Illinois.  The study’s results, when taken as a whole, indicated that some cancers were elevated in populations living near the Sterigenics facility in Willowbrook.   Many apparent differences and inconsistences, however, existed between genders, across study areas, and among cancer sites.  Further studies, preferably with larger populations and multiple facilities, are strongly recommended to confirm this assessment’s findings.

Cancer is a common disease, sometimes more common than many people believe. The National Cancer Institute estimates that one in two men in the United States has a lifetime risk of developing cancer; for women, the lifetime risk is one in three. The number of people with cancer is increasing in most communities, because more people are living to the ages of greatest cancer occurrence.

Cancer is the second most common cause of death in Illinois and the United States, and the leading cause of death for Illinois citizens aged 45-64. During 2009, the underlying cause of death for 24,182 Illinoisans was cancer. In the same year, new invasive cancer cases totaling 64,135 were diagnosed among Illinois residents. Cancer affects all racial and ethnic groups and kills more Illinoisans annually then AIDS, injuries and homicides combined.

Many types of cancer can be prevented, and the prospects for surviving cancer are better than ever before and continue to improve. Early detection and improved treatments are allowing more people who have been diagnosed with cancer to live longer and better. By adopting a healthier lifestyle and by visiting a physician regularly for a cancer-related checkup, many people could reduce their chances of developing or dying from cancer. Screening examinations, conducted regularly by a health care professional, can result in the detection of cancers of the breast, tongue, mouth, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis and melanomas at earlier stages, when treatment is more likely to be successful. More than half of all new cancer cases occur in the nine screening-accessible cancer sites listed above.

Depression
What is depression?
Everyone gets the blues now and then, but when there is little joy or pleasure after visiting with friends or after seeing a good movie, there may be a more serious problem. A depressed mood that stays around for a while, without letting up, can change the way a person thinks or feels. Doctors call this “clinical depression.”
Depression is a common, serious illness and not a personal weakness. Depression can happen to anyone, at any age, and to people of any race or ethnic group. It is never a “normal” part of life. Depression, which is treatable, can come from chemical imbalances in the brain, hormonal changes, medications or things going on in your life.

Women suffer from depression twice as often as men. One out of four women may have depression sometime during their lifetime. Many people suffer with depression but do not seek help.

What are the symptoms of depression?
If you experience five or more of the following symptoms and they last for more than two weeks, or if the symptoms interfere with your daily routine, see a doctor or a qualified mental health professional. A physical examination to rule out other illnesses may be recommended.

a persistent sad, anxious or “empty” mood
sleeping too little or too much
reduced appetite and weight loss, or increased appetite and weight gain
loss of interest or lack of pleasure in activities once enjoyed, including sex
restlessness or irritability
persistent physical symptoms that don't respond to treatment (such as headaches, chronic pain, or constipation and other digestive disorders)
difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions
fatigue or loss of energy
feeling guilty, hopeless or worthless
thoughts of death or suicide
What causes depression?
Many things can lead to clinical depression. Following are factors that can contribute to the illness:

Biological - People with depression may have too little or too much of certain brain chemicals. Changes in these brain chemicals may cause or play a role in clinical depression.
Cognitive - People with negative thinking and low self-esteem are more likely to develop clinical depression.
Gender - Women experience clinical depression nearly twice as often as men. The reasons for this are still not understood, but may include hormonal changes women go through during menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and menopause. Other reasons may include the stress caused by the many responsibilities that women have.
Co-occurrence - Depression is more likely to occur along with certain illnesses, such as heart disease, cancer, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and hormonal disorders.
Medications - Side effects of some medications can bring about depression.
Genetic- A family history of clinical depression increases the risk for developing the illness.
Situational - Difficult life events, including divorce, financial problems or the death of a loved one can contribute to clinical depression.
How is depression treated?
Depression is the most treatable of all mental illnesses. About 60 percent to 80 percent of depressed people can be treated successfully. Depending on the case, various kinds of therapies seem to work. Treatments such as psychotherapy and support groups help people deal with major changes in life. Several short-term (12-20 weeks) “talk” therapies have proven useful. One method helps patients recognize and change negative thinking patterns that led to the depression. Another approach focuses on improving a patient's relationships with people as a way to reduce depression and feelings of despair.

Antidepressant drugs can also help. These medications can improve mood, sleep, appetite and concentration. There are several types of antidepressant drugs available. Drug therapies often take time before there are real signs of progress. It is important to keep taking medication until it has a chance to work. After feeling better, it is important to continue the medication for at least four to nine months to prevent a recurrence of the depression. Never stop taking an antidepressant without consulting your doctor. Antidepressant drugs can have side effects but they are usually temporary. If side effects persist and are troublesome, contact your doctor. In some cases, you may need to try different medicines to find the one(s) that help the most.

Are there things I can do to help myself?
Set realistic goals and don’t take on too many tasks.
Try to be with others and confide in someone.
Participate in activities that you enjoy.
Exercise in moderation.
Remember feeling better will take time.
Don’t make any important decisions until the depression has lifted.
Let your family and friends help you.

Diseases of the Heart and Stroke: Illinois’ Leading Killers
Heart disease and stroke are, respectively, the first and third leading causes of death, and also the major causes of disability in Illinois. In 2017 there were 25,393 deaths in Illinois due to heart disease and 6,021 deaths due to stroke.  Deaths due heart disease and stroke combined (31,414) represent almost 29 percent of all deaths in Illinois in 2017 (109,726).

Prevention efforts coupled with effective disease management can reduce the incidence of heart attacks and strokes, cut the number of deaths from these diseases, and relieve some of the disability suffered by heart attack and stroke survivors.

The Illinois Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Program focuses The ABC's of Cardiovascular Health:

Aspirin therapy
Blood pressure control (including sodium reduction)
Cholesterol management
Smoking cessation
The Illinois Department of Public Health and its partner agencies and colleagues around the state are making significant progress in raising awareness about heart disease and stroke and helping people to understand their risk factors. Successful programs are in place to reduce tobacco use; to increase daily physical activity and consumption of fruits, vegetables and low-fat milk; and to change environmental and policy systems that can have an impact on heart disease and stroke.

In September 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services launched the Million Hearts campaign in support of a national initiative to prevent one million heart attacks by 2017. In September 2013, IDPH held the first Million Hearts stakeholders workshop to engage providers, insurance companies, nursing associations, and many others to raise awareness of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. From this workshop, two subcommittees were formed to address the ABCS of cardiovascular disease (aspirin therapy, blood pressure control, cholesterol control, and smoking cessation) and to lower the risk factor of uncontrolled high blood pressure, or hypertension.

Oral Cancer
RESOURCES PUBLICATIONS 
What is Oral Cancer?
Oral cancer starts in the mouth (oral cavity) and can interfere with the ability to breath, talk, eat, chew or swallow. The oral cavity is easy to examine. When found early, treatment of oral cancer is likely to be successful.

According to the Illinois State Cancer Registry, about 1,480 new cases of oral and pharyngeal cancer will be diagnosed in Illinois in 2008 . Of these, about 1,040 will be in men and about 440 will be in women. About 350 Illinoisans are expected to die of oral and pharyngeal cancer in 2008. Oral cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer in African-American men.

What are the Causes and Risk Factors of Oral Cancer?
Some people with oral cancer do not have any known risk factors and others with several risk factors never develop the disease. Important risk factors are listed below.

Tobacco
About 90 percent of people with oral cancer use tobacco. The risk of developing these cancers increases with the amount smoked or chewed and the duration of the habit. Smokers are six times more likely than nonsmokers to develop these cancers. Smokeless tobacco ("snuff" or chewing tobacco) is associated with cancers of the cheek, gums and inner surface of the lips. Smokeless tobacco increases the risk of these cancers by about 50 times.

Alcohol
Drinking alcohol greatly increases a smoker's risk of developing oral cancer. About 75 percent to 80 percent of all patients with oral cancer drink alcohol. People who drink alcohol but don’t smoke have a higher risk of cancer, if they are heavy drinkers. The combination of tobacco and alcohol is deadly.

Ultraviolet light
More than 30 percent of patients with cancers of the lip have outdoor occupations associated with prolonged exposure to sunlight.

Poor nutrition
A diet low in fruits and vegetables is associated with an increased risk of developing oral cancer.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
The current studies indicate HPV may contribute to the development of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers in around 20 percent of people.

Age
The likelihood of developing oral and pharyngeal cancer increases with age. Half of all cases are in persons older than age 65; 90 percent are older than age 45.

What are the Symptoms of Oral Cancer?
The common symptoms of oral cancer include:

sore in the mouth that does not heal (most common symptom)
pain in the mouth that does not go away (also very common)
persistent lump or thickening in the cheek
persistent white or red patch on the gums, tongue, tonsil or lining of the mouth
sore throat or a feeling that something is caught in the throat that does not go away
difficulty chewing or swallowing
difficulty moving the jaw or tongue
numbness of the tongue or other area of the mouth
swelling of the jaw that causes dentures to fit poorly or become uncomfortable
loosening of the teeth or pain around the teeth or jaw
voice changes
lump or mass in the neck
unintentional weight loss
persistent bad breath
These symptoms can be caused by many other conditions. It is important to report any of these symptoms (lasting more than two weeks) to a dentist or physician.

How to Prevent Oral Cancer:
Most oral cancers can be prevented by avoiding risk factors whenever possible.

Tobacco and alcohol are the largest risk factors for oral cancer. The best way to prevent this cancer is to never start smoking or using smokeless tobacco. If you use tobacco now, quit. If you drink, reduce alcohol intake. Most oral cancers could be prevented if people did not use tobacco or drink heavily.
To avoid getting cancer of the lips from the sun, stay inside or in the shade during the middle of the day, when the sun’s rays are most damaging. Minimize exposure to the sun by wearing a wide-brimmed hat. Use lip protection with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 and reapply frequently while outside.
Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day and six to 11 servings of bread, cereal, grain, rice, pasta or beans. Eat less high-fat meat, dairy products and processed food.
Examine your mouth monthly and see a dentist or doctor if any symptoms occur. At least once a year, ask a doctor or dentist to screen you for oral cancer.
